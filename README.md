# google-keyword-crawler

### Overview:
This Python script automates the process of searching for **keywords** in Google and fetching the search result URLs. It reads keywords from an **Excel file**, performs **pagination** in the Google search results, and then writes the **URLs** back into the Excel file.

### Libraries Used:
- **`openpyxl`**: To read and write **Excel files**.
- **`requests`**: To make **HTTP requests** to Google search.
- **`BeautifulSoup`**: To **parse HTML content** and extract URLs.
- **`time`**: To **add delays** between requests to avoid being blocked by Google.
- **`urllib.parse`**: To **safely encode** the search query in the URL.

### Functions:

#### **`fetch_google_results(query, start_index=0)`**:
- Takes a **search query** and an optional `start_index` (for pagination).
- **Fetches** Google search results and returns a list of **URLs**.
- Sends an HTTP request to Google, **parses the HTML** using BeautifulSoup, and extracts the valid URLs.

#### **`search_and_update_excel(file_name)`**:
- Loads an **existing Excel file**.
- Reads **keywords** from the first column.
- Fetches Google search result URLs for each keyword using the `fetch_google_results()` function.
- **Writes the URLs** into the Excel file, starting from the second column.

### How to Use:

#### 1. **Prepare the Excel File**:
   - Create an Excel file with a sheet named **"Google Search Results"**.
   - The **first column** should contain the list of keywords you want to search for.

#### 2. **Run the Script**:
   - Place the Python script in the same directory as your **Excel file**.
   - Ensure both the script and the Excel file are in the same directory, or update the file path in the script accordingly.
   - Run the script to fetch **Google search results** and update the Excel file with the URLs.

#### 3. **Results**:
   - The script will fetch **search results** for each keyword in the Excel file.
   - It will **write the first 40 URLs** (from 4 pages of 10 results each) starting from **column B** in the file.

### File Output:
- The updated Excel file will contain the **search result URLs** starting from **column B**.

### Important Notes:
- **Delays Between Requests**: The script adds a **5-second delay** between fetching each page of results to prevent being blocked by Google.
- **Google Blocking**: Frequent requests may lead to **temporary blocks** from Google. Please use the script responsibly and avoid overloading Google’s servers.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes **error handling** for failed requests or invalid keywords to ensure it runs smoothly.

### ⚠️ Warning:
**This script may result in your activities being flagged as robotic behavior by Google if you run it too many times in a short period.** Google may block or temporarily suspend your access if it detects repeated automated requests. **Do not run the script excessively** or at high frequency to avoid being blocked.

### Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- Install the required libraries using **pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install openpyxl requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

### Use Case:
By running this script, you can **automatically fetch and store Google search results** for a list of keywords. This is helpful for:
- **Tracking search engine rankings** over time.
- **Gathering data** for SEO research or analysis.
